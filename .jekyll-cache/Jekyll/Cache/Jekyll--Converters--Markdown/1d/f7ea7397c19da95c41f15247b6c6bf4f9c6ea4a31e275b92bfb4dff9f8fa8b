I"<p>I’m a graduate student in Computational Science at RWTH Aachen University. I leverage numerical mathematics, high performance computing and machine learning to investigate intractable engineering questions, ranging from those in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to Autonomous Driving. My projects have had a strong automotive focus, with experience at Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG on a variety of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) workflows.
