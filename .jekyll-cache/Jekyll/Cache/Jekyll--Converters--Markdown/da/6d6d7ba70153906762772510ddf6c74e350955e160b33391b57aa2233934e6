I"X<p>I spent a summer with a research group specializing in a variety of topics in non-linear dynamics, one of them being the Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) of flapping wings. It was 2015 — I did not work with OpenFOAM then, but I’m sure the more recent FSI solvers with foam-extend were only in their infancy, in terms of popularity.</p>
