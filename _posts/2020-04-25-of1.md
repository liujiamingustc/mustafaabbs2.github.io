title: Setting up my OpenFOAM Development Environment on Windows!
---

Well, if you’re this far, you’re no stranger to open source fluid simulation software. Or you’ve finally broken free from the binds that commercial CFD software pose — “I’m just going to do it myself”, you say all too confidently as you jostle out of your fifteenth meeting with your software support that month.

A full Linux development environment is often too intimidating for those just starting to make a switch from commercial tools to OpenFOAM. Windows until recently was, and to some extent still is, a poor solution for numerical computing. [The NTFS file system on Windows is slower than the ext4 for frequent I/O which is a mainstay of computing applications.](https://www.pcworld.com/article/230527/ubuntu_linux_day_16_ext4_vs_ntfs.html) There were limited options to those looking to run OpenFOAM on Windows without a dual-boot.

1. A [VM install](https://openfoam.org/download/windows-vm/) was the go-to solution, however I found that it significantly slowed my host device.

1. A native Windows build, [blueCFD-Core](http://bluecfd.github.io/Core/About/), based on a [MSys2](https://www.msys2.org/) build platform (built with on a Cygwin layer for the Linux “feel” and MinGw, for compilation on Windows.). The full software stack makes it quite bulky for use.

1. [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10): The original WSL is a GNU environment for Windows without any virtualization, and with a very slow read/write ability to the Windows file system.

My move to Windows was recent — circumstances around the pandemic made me switch to a new system which I did not want to have a dual boot on. Luckily, we live in times of the [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-index). The new version of the architecture in WSL allows increased file system performance, perations like cmake and git clone can run up to 20x faster — count me in.

I will not describe setting up the WSL 2 VM in this article. There is a fairly comprehensive install guide [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

1. Once you have WSL ready, download the OpenFOAM release ([here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openfoam/files/v1912/OpenFOAM-v1912-windows10.tgz), 19.12).

1. Copy the .tgz to your folder of choice.

    cp -ar /mnt/c/Users/<USER>/Downloads/OpenFOAM-v1912-windows10.tgz .

3. Untar to the /opt folder and change permissions.

    sudo tar -xvzf  OpenFOAM-v1912-windows10.tgz -C /opt/
    sudo chown -R $USER /opt/OpenFOAM

4. Source your .bashrc file!

    echo "source /opt/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v1912/etc/bashrc" >> ~/.bashrc
    source $HOME/.bashrc

And you’re good to go. Verify your source by running a tutorial case.

The purpose of this article is to set up a **development** environment for OpenFOAM — you need to create:

1. A directory that houses your custom solver and library source code. This is preferably somewhere in your **$WM_PROJECT_DIR** folder.

1. Directories for the binaries generated from your custom solver and the .so files generated from your custom library. You’ll need to create a directory that is defined by your variables **$FOAM_USER_APPBIN** and **$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN **respectively.

This is how my custom solver and library directory (as described in 1.) should look like:

myReactingParcelFoam is my custom solver modifying reactingParcelFoam, and surfaceFilmModels is where I hold the libraries that the solver depends on.

Notice the vscode folder? The perfect pair to OpenFOAM programming, as I’ve discovered, is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can download this to run on your Windows system. Yes — you run it on Windows and keep the source in your WSL environment. You need to install the [remote WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote-tutorials/wsl/getting-started) in VS Code to couple the two environments. Additionally, install the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) too.

Voila! All you need to do is run the following command in the directory you want to create a VS Code directory for:

    code . 

This creates a .vscode folder in that directory. Additionally, it will open up VS Code with your project, for instance:

The files in .vscode that are of relevance are: *launch.json*, *tasks.json *and *c_cpp_properties.json*. These will be created when you add a configuration, but you will have to modify them. These give VS Code inputs on what task to run.

![A sample launch.json file](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HJZ4TXPlKAzGRgzHYAZhfA.png)*A sample launch.json file*

If you’ve gone through these .json files, the command in *tasks.json* is **wmake**, which is a wrapper around make for OpenFOAM. This is given a label **wmake-build **which is referenced in the “preLaunchTask” field in *launch.json*.

“program” specifies where to deposit the binary from the executable. As discussed, this should be in **$FOAM_USER_APPBIN.**

The final .json file, *c_cpp_properties.json*, contains the include paths for the compiler, as well as the settings for Intellisense.

Edit the Make/files to make sure your binary ends up in the right place after wmake.

This process is very similar for compiling your own libraries. You will have to write in **wmake libso **in the *tasks.json* file instead to compile all the .so files.

And voila, you can compile OpenFOAM code! Complete with code completion and references to other code blocks — this allows for a seamless start into the freedom OpenFOAM development brings with it.
